# Sprint 1 Retrospective
## Results
### User-related Criteria
- Single player and multiplayer game modes have been created.
- Players can access the game on a public website.
- Players can use an on-screen keyboard to enter guesses.
- Players see their guessed letters come up on the board.

### Developer-related Criteria
-  A word dictionary consists of all valid and answer words in the game.
- A trunk-based development work structure was established.
- Limited testing has been implemented.
- User information (username) is accepted and stored.
- The webpage is hosted on Azure.


### Stories
- 9 user stories were allocated for Sprint 1.
- 2 developer-sized stories were allocated for Sprint 1.

- All of the 11 stories have been completed.

- 1 bug (resulting from a merge conflict) was fixed.

- The sum total of points allocated to the stories is: 19

        Estimated velocity = 19 points/sprint 
        Actual velocity = 20 points/sprint (included a bug fix)

### Successes
- All group members were able to complete either at least one developer-sized story or one user story.

- There was consistent and clear communication between group members, where everyone was able to report back on which stories had been completed.

- The majority of user and developer-sized stories were completed within a comfortable time-frame, thereby eliminating last-minute pressure on the day of the sprint completion.

- A dynamic webpage has been created, which contains both single player and multiplayer game modes.

### Failures & Areas for Improvement
- The team faced merge conflits in this sprint. In order to avoid this going forward, stories should be independent, in that if one member is working on one story or code file, other members should steer clear from these for the time being, until the story is completed.

- Going forward user stories need to be:
    - more clearly defined.
    - evenly distributed in size (with regards to amount of work required and points allocated).

- This Sprint has not completed a minimum viable product to the full extent. The user of the game can enter a word, but is not actually engaging in a game since they will not be 'rewarded' for entering the correct answer. 

- Minimal testing has been implemented. Sprint 2 should include higher test coverage, since the game functionality wil be implemented in this sprint. This must be done to a fuller extent through thorough research.
